# 🐘 Jprogram PHP Projects

🌍 Leia em [Portuguese](README.md)

Hello! 👋

Welcome to the space where I gather my **PHP** projects — from simple scripts and APIs to complete applications developed to practice, test ideas, and grow as a developer.

## 🎯 About the organization

I created **Jprogram-PHP-Projects** to centralize everything I’ve been developing with **PHP**.

Here you’ll find everything from exercises and small utilities to systems using modern frameworks and web development best practices.

The goals of this organization are:

* Consolidate my PHP portfolio
* Keep track of my progress and learning
* Experiment with different approaches, patterns, and tools
* Share knowledge and inspire other PHP learners

## 🧠 Technologies & practices

I usually work with:

* **PHP 8+**
* **Composer** for dependency management
* **PDO** and **MySQL** for data persistence
* **Slim**, **Laravel**, or **pure PHP** projects
* **PHPUnit** for testing
* Focus on **clean code**, **good practices**, and **modular organization**
